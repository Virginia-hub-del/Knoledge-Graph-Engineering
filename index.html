            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Microbial communities, or microbiomes, are complex networks of microorganisms—such as bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses—that interact in various environments, from soil and water ecosystems to the human body. These interactions, including competition, cooperation, and predation, shape the community dynamics and influence the survival of specific species. Microbes respond to factors like nutrient availability, pH, and the introduction of new species, affecting the microbiome’s structure, function, and stability. For example, some microbes compete for resources, while others form symbiotic relationships, benefiting from each other's by-products. These ecological interactions contribute to the resilience and adaptability of microbial ecosystems, influencing broader ecological and host-related processes.</p>

        <p>To measure the relative abundance of microbial species, several techniques are used, including flow cytometry, microarrays, ribosomal RNA analysis, and metagenomic sequencing. Clustering of sequence data with reference databases is essential for determining overall abundances and taxonomic classifications.</p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>Scope Definition</h2>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Informal Purpose:</strong> The objective is to construct a Knowledge Graph (KG) to explore how microorganisms interact with and relate to diseases, with a particular focus on the role of the microbiome in human health.</li>
            <li><strong>Domain of Interest (DoI):</strong> The goal is to analyze the relative abundances of species in healthy individuals compared to those who are ill, specifically focusing on cancers, using the curatedMetagenomicData package in R.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>Scenario Definition</h2>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Species Interactions (S1):</strong> Explores the ecological relationships between microbial species, including cooperation and competition, and their impact on the stability of microbial communities.</li>
            <li><strong>Microbiome Epidemiology (S2):</strong> Analyzes the influence of geographic and socio-economic factors on microbial profiles and disease outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Microbiome Risk Factor Analysis (S3):</strong> Examines how risk factors such as smoking, alcohol, diet, and medications influence the microbiome and increase susceptibility to diseases.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>2. Information Gathering</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The project started by gathering relevant data from the curatedMetagenomicData (cMD) package in R, which includes microbiome data from several independent studies. This data provides detailed information on gene families, marker abundance, pathway coverage, and relative abundance for each collected sample. The focus of the information gathering process was on obtaining relative abundance data, which was then used to identify patterns of microbial variation across healthy individuals and those with colorectal cancer. Factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and disease location were considered to enhance the understanding of species interactions and the relationship between microbial composition and health conditions.</p>
        
        <p>Competency Questions are used to validate the functionality of the knowledge graph. The questions below are based on hypothetical personas and situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CQ-1 (P1-S1):</strong> Haruto is curious about how different microbes in his body interact and whether these interactions could impact his health, especially given his recent stage I cancer diagnosis and his long history of smoking.</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-2 (P2-S2):</strong> Yuki doesn’t understand why he is finally losing weight. Could he be facing an imbalance of the microbiome that impacted his weight?</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-3 (P3-S3):</strong> Given that Emiko is a healthy woman, what can be observed in the relative abundances of her microbiome?</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-4 (P4-S1):</strong> Given Riku’s stage IV cancer diagnosis, which microbial species are characteristic of advanced patients with cancer?</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-5 (P5-S3):</strong> After noticing blood in his stool, Kaito is anxious about his health. Can we infer if he has a high chance of developing gastrointestinal problems?</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-6 (P6-S2):</strong> How does Aiko’s alcohol consumption influence the composition and abundance of bacteria in her microbiome?</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-7 (P7-S1):</strong> Hana, in good health, wonders about positive co-occurrence relationships in her microbiome.</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-8 (P8-S2):</strong> Ren is curious about his high levels of Helicobacter pylori. How does its abundance correlate with other microbial species?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>3. Language Definition</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The language used in this project is based on a semantic framework designed to ensure the consistent representation of complex relationships between biological entities and health metrics. This framework addresses potential linguistic ambiguity by associating each concept with a formal definition. The Universal Knowledge Core (UKC) serves as the primary resource for defining most concepts, while additional ontologies available on BioPortal are used for specific biological terms. Concepts that could not be found in existing ontologies are assigned unique identifiers. The methodology follows the iTelos approach, with the identification and classification of Etypes, object properties, and data properties, providing a structured language dataset for the project.</p>
        
        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>4. Knowledge Definition</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The knowledge in the graph is organized into categories such as microbiome composition, cancer stages, and health profiles of individuals, all structured within the kTelos phase. These categories are connected to relevant concepts and entities, forming a semantic structure that allows for easy retrieval of information linked to specific health conditions.</p>
        <p>The knowledge definition process involved integrating data from multiple sources and ontologies, with a focus on the Ontology for Human-Microbe Interactions (OHMI) and the Disease Ontology (DOID). These ontologies provide detailed categorizations of microbiome interactions and diseases, including cancer stages. The knowledge resources created aim to standardize information representation, enhancing the interoperability and reusability of the Knowledge Graph (KG).</p>
        <p>In this phase, the kTelos methodology was applied, with a focus on both the producer and consumer activities. On the producer side, ontologies were developed for each dataset, while on the consumer side, a unified ontology was designed for the final composite KG. This resulted in a structured representation of entities, object properties, and data properties, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between entities like microbiomes, cancer, and individual health profiles.</p>
        
        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>5. Entity Definition</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Entities in the project represent biological entities such as microbes, cancer types, and health-related biomarkers. Each entity has attributes like age, gender, health status, and disease stage, which help in understanding their role in the broader context of cancer research.</p>
