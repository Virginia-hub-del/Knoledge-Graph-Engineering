    <h2>8. Open issues</h2>
    <p>We successfully built a knowledge graph that represents interactions between individuals, their microbiome species, and species interactions. However, our dataset only included one cancer type, which can be expanded by integrating data on multiple cancers in future studies.</p>

    <p>A key limitation is the inability to statistically evaluate the results due to the arbitrary threshold for classifying species' relative abundances. Future research should use machine learning for better data analysis and insights.</p>

    <p>Other studies may group specific microbiome species and compare their relative abundances. The lack of time-series data in this study could also limit deeper insights into species-species interactions over time.</p>
