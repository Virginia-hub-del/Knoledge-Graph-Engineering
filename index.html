        <h1>KGE 2025 - Ecological Relations Between Members of the Microbiome</h1>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
            <p>Microbial communities, or microbiomes, consist of microorganisms such as bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses, interacting within ecosystems like soil, water, and the human body. These interactions, including competition, cooperation, and predation, influence microbiome structure, stability, and species abundance. These ecological relationships respond to environmental factors such as nutrient availability and microbial species changes, shaping the microbiome's functionality and resilience.</p>
    
            <p>To determine species relative abundance in microbial species, techniques like flow cytometry, ribosomal RNA, and metagenomic sequencing are used. The process involves clustering sequences with reference databases for taxonomic classification.</p>

            <h3><strong>Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE) and Reusability</strong></h3>
            <p>Reusability is a core principle in the KGE process defined by iTelos. The documentation created during the project enhances resource reusability by providing clear descriptions of the process and activities, aiding future use of the project's outcomes.</p>

            <h2><strong>1. Purpose Definition</strong></h2>
        </div>
      
        <p>The main objective is to construct a Knowledge Graph revealing insights into how microorganisms interact and relate to diseases like colorectal cancer, aiming to enhance our understanding of the microbiome's role in human health.</p>
    
        <h2><strong>Domain of Interest (DoI)</strong></h2>
        <p>This project examines microbial abundances in healthy individuals versus those with diseases, focusing on colorectal cancer using the <code>curatedMetagenomicData</code> (cMD) package in R.

                    <p>The lack of a clearly defined language resource for representing Etypes and their properties presents challenges. Words can be interpreted differently, and some are polysemous, making them ambiguous. To address this, concepts are associated with formal definitions using the Universal Knowledge Core (UKC), a high-quality, diversity-aware database.</p>
                    <p>Following the iTelos methodology, concepts representing Etypes, object properties, and data properties were identified in Phase 1, leading to the creation of a language dataset in CSV format. The dataset includes formally defined concepts tailored to the domain.</p>

                    <div class="section-header">
                        <h2>4. Knowledge Definition</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>The knowledge in the graph is organized into categories such as microbiome composition, cancer stages, and health profiles of individuals, all structured within the kTelos phase. These categories are connected to relevant concepts and entities, forming a semantic structure that allows for easy retrieval of information linked to specific health conditions.</p>
                    <p>The knowledge definition process involved integrating data from multiple sources and ontologies, with a focus on the Ontology for Human-Microbe Interactions (OHMI) and the Disease Ontology (DOID). These ontologies provide detailed categorizations of microbiome interactions and diseases, including cancer stages. The knowledge resources created aim to standardize information representation, enhancing the interoperability and reusability of the Knowledge Graph (KG).</p>
                    <p>In this phase, the goal was to integrate the teleology with the structured CSV files containing cleaned data to develop a comprehensive knowledge graph. This step was essential to ensure consistency in identifying entities, data properties, and object properties while addressing data heterogeneity across different sources.</p>
                    <p>Initially, the CSV file containing relative species abundances was modified, as it originally used person IDs as row names, making integration difficult. To accurately represent the relationships between individuals and microbial species, the CSV structure was redefined to have person IDs as a column, allowing a single person to be associated with multiple species across different rows.</p>
                    <p>The process involved three key steps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Entity Matching:</strong> Ensuring consistency by using person IDs as unique identifiers across datasets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Entity Identification:</strong> Introducing unique identifiers (URIs) for entities like Risk Factor, Cancer, and Microbiome.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Mapping:</strong> Linking the teleology to the data using Karma, producing Turtle-RDF files that were merged into a final knowledge graph.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Throughout this phase, data heterogeneity was managed and the final output was a structured knowledge graph, which serves as the foundation for further analysis and knowledge extraction.</p>

                        <p>Initially, the CSV file was modified to better model the interaction between species and individuals. The person IDs were moved to a column for proper data integration. A person can be associated with multiple species, so person IDs appear multiple times in the dataset.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Entity Definition Sub-Activities:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Entity Matching:</strong> The person entity exists in both files, and the person_id is used as a unique identifier to match individuals across datasets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Entity Identification:</strong> Entities such as Risk Factor, Cancer, and Person are identified, with unique identifiers for Risk Factor and Cancer, and the Microbiome entity is identified by species name.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Mapping:</strong> Karma links the teleology to the data, including all entities with their URIs. The RDF files produced by Karma were merged into one final graph.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Query 1:</strong> Retrieves the maximum average relative abundance of species in cancer patients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Query 2:</strong> Identifies species with high relative abundance in cancer patients with stage IV cancer and high alcohol consumption.</li>
                            <li><strong>Query 3:</strong> Highlights species with high relative abundance in cancer patients and low in healthy individuals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Query 4:</strong> Answers CQ-8, identifying individuals with Helicobacter pylori.</li>
                            <li><strong>Query 5:</strong> Measures the distance in relative abundance between species in 'Healthy' vs 'CRC' populations.</li>

    <h2>7. Metadata Definition</h2>
    <p>This section defines the metadata for the resources produced throughout the project. The metadata describes both the final and intermediate results of the project. It is crucial for sharing the resources through data catalogs such as DataScientia.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Project Metadata</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Language Resource Metadata</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge Resource Metadata</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Data Resource Metadata</strong></li>

    <h2>8. Open issues</h2>
    <p>We successfully built a knowledge graph that represents interactions between individuals, their microbiome species, and species interactions. However, our dataset only included one cancer type, which can be expanded by integrating data on multiple cancers in future studies.</p>

    <p>A key limitation is the inability to statistically evaluate the results due to the arbitrary threshold for classifying species' relative abundances. Future research should use machine learning for better data analysis and insights.</p>

    <p>Other studies may group specific microbiome species and compare their relative abundances. The lack of time-series data in this study could also limit deeper insights into species-species interactions over time.</p>
