# KGE-2024 Knowledge Graph Project

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to create a Knowledge Graph (KG) to support the analysis of competencies and competency queries (CQs). The project was developed using the iTelos methodology, focusing on evaluating the quality and reliability of the KG by executing various Competency Queries and assessing the KG's alignment with reference ontologies.

The key phases of the project include:
- Knowledge Graph creation
- Execution of Competency Queries (CQs)
- Evaluation of the KG's quality through property and EType analysis
- Metadata definition for project distribution

## How to Run the Code
Follow the steps below to run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Virginia-hub-del/Knowledge-Graph-Engineering
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the code**  
   To execute the main script, use the following command:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Competency Queries
The project includes several Competency Queries (CQs) executed on the Knowledge Graph to test its capability to fulfill the project's purpose. Each CQ explores different relationships within the KG and tests its alignment with the project's objectives.

## Repository Structure
The repository structure is as follows:

```
/Knoledge-Graph-Engineering
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ /docs/                 # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ /src/                  # Source code
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.py            # Main script
â”œâ”€â”€ /data/                 # Data used in the project
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data.csv           # Example data file
â”œâ”€â”€ /notebooks/            # Jupyter notebooks
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ analysis.ipynb     # Data analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # This file
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Project dependencies
```

## Metadata Definition
The project includes the definition of metadata for all the resources produced. Metadata describes both the final outcomes and intermediate results from each phase (language, schema, and data source standardized values).

The metadata is essential for sharing the produced resources through data catalogs, such as DataScientia catalogs. The structure of this section includes:
- Project metadata description
- Language resources metadata description
- Knowledge resources metadata description
- Data resources metadata description

## Open Issues
This section concludes the project with the final assessment of the process and outcomes, along with a description of unresolved issues due to time or other constraints.

The key questions addressed in this section include:
- Did the project meet the expected timeline?
- Were the final results able to satisfy the initial purpose?
- If not entirely, what parts of the purpose were not fully addressed?

Additionally, this section summarizes the most relevant issues encountered during the iTelos process and describes the approaches attempted to resolve them, as well as any proposed solutions that were not implemented.
